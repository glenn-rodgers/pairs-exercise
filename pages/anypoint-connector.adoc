= Anypoint Connector Tutorial

After learning some of the basic functionality in the Basic Studio Tutorial and How to Create a Mule App Tutorial, it's time to try your hand at enriching your application with an *Anypoint Connector*. To find all certified connectors, see xref:exchange::index.adoc[Anypoint Exchange]. //It would be good to link to the mentioned tutorials.

== What is an Anypoint Connector?

Anypoint Connectors are extensions that will allow for you to connect external systems such as Salesforce, Google Contacts, ServiceNow, Workday, Facebook, Twitter, or MongoDB to integrate information from these systems into your project. Connectors simplify the interaction with the SaaS providers' API's. Connectors provide methods for most of all of the available operations.

== How to Configure

You will perform these steps to configure a connector:

. Store the authentication, connection, or other settings in a *properties file*. 
. Reference the properties from the *connector configuration*. Anypoint Studio (Studio) automatically stores the connector configuration as a global element for use by any other connector instance using the same properties.
. Test the connection from the configuration dialog.

[TIP]
You can use Properties files to provide a convenient mechanism for storing variables in a central location.

Alot of the functionality of connectors is dependent upon its target. There are many features most connectors might have in common. After creating and running the applications in this tutorial, you can apply what you've learned to connect applications to various SaaS applications.

== Prerequisites

You must have:

* Anypoint Studio
* Experience with Eclipse or an Eclipse-based IDE + 
See the Anypoint Studio interface in the xref:6@studio::basic-studio-tutorial.adoc[Basic] tutorial, if you do not have any previous experience with Eclipse or an Eclipse-based IDE.
* Experience with Global Elements in Mule +
See the xref:content-based-routing.adoc[Content-Based Routing] tutorial, if you do not have any previous experience with Global Elements. 
* Twitter developer access +
See <<Obtaining Access to the Twitter API>> for how to obtain Twitter developer access and create a simple app.

== Steps

In this tutorial, your will:

. Walk through the process for obtaining Twitter API access and credentials.
. Create an application in Anypoint studio that uses a connector to access the Twitter API.
. Learn how to use Global Elements and Foreach scope in the application.
. Run the application on a local runtime, which is embedded in Anypoint Studio.
. Test the application using a browser.
. Stop the app.
. _(Optional)_ Apply your knowledge to an extra credit challenge.

== Obtaining Access to the Twitter API

In order to use the Twitter API, you must have a Twitter developer account. If you don't already have one, create a https://twitter.com/signup[regular Twitter account]. You may wish to create an account specifically for testing in this exercise. To access your Twitter developer account, visit the https://dev.twitter.com/[Twitter dev.twitter.com Developer's page] and sign in using your Twitter account credentials. 

. This activity creates a separate developer account for you, with an association to your regular Twitter account.
. To create a new *Twitter Application*, navigate to https://apps.twitter.com/[https://apps.twitter.com/].
. Complete the *Application Details* form according to the table and image below.

|===
|Field |Value
|*Name* |A name for your application which must be unique to the Twitter system and which cannot contain the word "Twitter".
|*Description* |A brief overview of the application your building.
|*Website* |An entry is required here, however, because this Twitter application is not public, this field is not meaningful; enter a full URL placeholder value. You can simply use a name like `+http://www.example.com+`. Note that partial URLs like `example.com` are not accepted.
|*Callback URL* |Leave blank.

. Agree to the terms and click on the *Create your Twitter application* if you agree.
+
. Click on the *Keys and Access Tokens* tab and scroll down to click *Create my access token*.

[NOTE]
====
Using an access token, you can easily connect with the Twitter API using your application. However, your access to the API is restricted to your user account. For the purposes of this tutorial, an access token gives you the access which you need for your application to interact with the Twitter API.

Later, if you want to expose such an application publicly, you need to configure your application to authenticate via OAuth.
====
+
. Scroll down the page in the browser to display the values for *Access token* and *Access token secret* because you need to enter these values in Anypoint Studio record the following four keys from Twitter (refer to the image below):
.. Consumer Key
.. Consumer Secret
.. Access Token
.. Access Token Secret
